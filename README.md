# TileMap-Editor
Created using C++ and SFML.

controls:

pageDown - Next tile layout.

pageUp   - Previous tile layout.

Ctrl + A - Fill all the grid using the selected tile.

Alt + A  - Delete selected tile only from total grid.

Shift + A - Fill only in empty grid spaces using selected tile.

Q - delete total grids except transparent.

Del - Delete everthing in the grid.

R - Randamize entire grid using random tile in current tile layout.

Ctrl + Shift + S - Save current grid snap.

Ctrl + MOUSE_LEFT_CLICK - to select multiple tiles in tile layout.

It works but its still need lot to add like redo, undo and more. Its one of my old projects and now currently i am not working
in this.
